.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wine-app-packager
guides you in wrapping a Windows program in a Debian package,
based on wine. It will create a template Debian source package for you and
include the \fIC:\\\fR directory tree of your program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B wine-app-packager\fR init
creates a Debian source package directory. It will ask various pieces
of information. All the following commands will need to run within the
created directory.

.TP
.B wine-app-packager\fR prepare
creates a wine config directory in \fI~/.wine-<application>-master\fR, based on
the current content of the package (if any).

.TP
.B wine-app-packager\fR run \fI<cmd>\fR
runs \fR<cmd>\fR in a way that \fBWINEPREFIX\fR is set correctly, i.e.
.nf
wine-app-packager run wine /tmp/install.exe
.fi
or
.nf
wine-app-packager run wine C:\\\\Applications\\\\DemoApplication\\\\DemoApplication.exe
.fi

.TP
.B wine-app-packager\fR commit
takes the changes you made in \fI~/.wine-<application>-master\fR and puts them
back into the Debian source package. Ususally, this will be followed by
calls to \fBdebchange\fR and \fBdebuild\fR to build the package.
Removes \fI~/.wine-<application>-master\fR afterwards.

.TP
.B wine-app-packager\fR abort
Just removes \fI~/.wine-<application>-master\fR, throwing away all changes.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

A typical run of \fBwine-app-packager\fR that creates a new package, builds it and run the program would look like this (only user input shown):
.PP
.nf
$ wine-app-packager init
7z
1.2.3
$ cd 7z-1.2.3
$ wine-app-packager prepare
$ wine-app-packager run /tmp/7z465.exe
$ wine-app-packager commit
$ edit ./z7 # set the EXE= variable
$ debuild -uc -us
$ sudo debi
$ 7z
.fi
